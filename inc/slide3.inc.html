        An architectural style of programming; opinionated with a focus on
        statelessness and a separation of concerns.

    <h3>Stateless?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No memory of a client between requests
        <ul>
          <li>clients are responsible for saving state</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Requires a token to authenticate each request</li>
      <li>Flexible, scalable, replicable</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Monolithic software design is difficult with teams</li>
      <li>Developers may have different specializations</li>
      <li>Higher risk of bugs and errors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
    <p>
      Using RESTful APIs, developers are able to maintain and update front-end
      and back-end codebases separately.
      <br /><br />
      APIs can act as a single source of truth to multiple clients that have no
      relationship to eachother besides being consumers of the same API.
